    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/11": "Treasure?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/12": "Hmm. You guys have a long way to go before you're ready to hear about treasure beyond your wildest dreams.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/13": "Now, dragonguard recruits... move out!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/2": "Actually, I was just going to my room.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/3": "I had a question for Adeline...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/4": "It's more like I'm here to recruit the Dragonguard?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/5": "For new duties! Like litter pickup!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/6": "Don't worry, Dell. I'm here because I totally believe in the dragonguys!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/7": "Boy oh boy... I can't say I'm impressed with the quality of recruits these days.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/8": "I guess Olric will be the only one to hear about the treasure I found.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/9": "Treasure?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/init": "While everyone down there is playing, we're up here doing the real work.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_adeline/init": "Dell mentioned Dragonguard treasure the other day... do you suppose the Dragonguard is financially solvent?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_balor/1": "My mind is racing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_balor/init": "What could Dell's treasure be? Gems? A cache of tesserae? Ancient coins?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_juniper/1": "Do you know what it is?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_juniper/init": "It's not like I even want to know what Dell's treasure is...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_olric/1": "I bet it's a cool rock!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_olric/init": "What do you think Dell's treasure is?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/1": "I can't just tell you, Miss Juniper. You have to prove yourselves!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/2": "It's the Dragonguard's job to help the town. So what have you done for Mistria this week?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/3": "Well, I coordinated the town's postings for the request board.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/4": "I sourced and imported a variety of supplies that are otherwise difficult to obtain in Mistria.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/5": "I trained extra hard this week!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/6": "I... heroically ordered the most expensive bottle of wine at the inn! Thereby contributing to the great wheel of the Mistrian economy!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/7": "You're really holding the other recruits back here, Miss Juniper. But I guess we can decide what to do with the treasure... next week.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/init": "Okay, Dell. It's time we had a talk, grown-up to kid. What's the Dragonguard's treasure?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/1": "Hmm... I'll allow it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/10": "Wow, these are really cool ideas!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/11": "This is going to be great! Once we find it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/12": "Find it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/13": "I forgot where I buried it! And as the new recruits, you guys have to find it and dig it up.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/14": "I see... Well.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/15": "Maybe we can borrow shovels from Eiland...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/2": "Let's use the treasure to invest towards Mistria's development. Putting the resources into something the whole town can enjoy would make it everyone's treasure!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/3": "But Adeline, it's not everyone's treasure, it's the Dragonguard's treasure.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/4": "I propose that the treasure be invested into the Dragonguard's future. A small fortune today could become a vast resource tomorrow.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/5": "With the right guidance from yours truly, of course.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/6": "Give the treasure to me, and I'll let you and your \"Dragonguards\" pester me as much as you like at the bathhouse. This is a great offer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/7": "What if we asked Reina to make us a huuuuge apple pie, and had a pie eating contest?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/8": "Olric, we're talking about what to do with the treasure.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/9": "Oh yeah!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/init": "Since we're deciding what to do with the Dragonguard's treasure this week, we all came up with proposals!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/1": "None at all.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/10": "It's a nice rock, Dell.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/11": "I've seen better.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/12": "Even I can't figure out how to turn that into money...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/13": "Sweet rock, Dell!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/14": "The Dragonguard really has it all!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/2": "No luck...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/3": "You do all realize she never told us what it is? What were you all even looking for?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/4": "Oh, didn't I tell you? I found it under my bed! Want to see?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/5": "...!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/6": "Whoa! This...!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/7": "This is...!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/8": "Dell... this is a rock.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/9": "Yeah!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_4/dragonguard_4/init": "None of you had any luck finding Dell's lost treasure?"
