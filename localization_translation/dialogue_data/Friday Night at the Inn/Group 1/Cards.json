    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_1/cards_1/2": "Wish I could say... I just deal the cards, man.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_1/cards_1/3": "I'm in for fifty more tesserae.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_1/cards_1/4": "Ho ho... that bluff won't work on me. Are you quite certain you don't need any more cards, Nora?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_1/cards_1/5": "Are YOU sure you don't need any more cards, Errol?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_1/cards_1/6": "Now now, let's keep it friendly... no need to get worked up.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_1/cards_1/7": "Hey guys, four of a kind is good, right? Or should I hold out for five of a kind? Guys?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_1/cards_1/init": "Hit me.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_2/cards_2/3": "Don't think you can hide your reaction from me, Errol... I know all your tells!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_2/cards_2/4": "The problem both of you have is that your little rivalry blinds you to the rest of the table. Isn't that right, Ryis?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_2/cards_2/5": "I wouldn't know about that, Miss Terithia... I just like dealing and doing card tricks. Watch this!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_2/cards_2/6": "Whoaaaa, nice moves bro! By the way, is this a full house?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_2/cards_2/init": "Olric's four of a kind was beginner's luck... this time, the pot is mine.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_3/cards_3/1": "Yes... a truce... so we can take down Olric.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_3/cards_3/2": "I'm with you... I can't let Olric smudge my reputation...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_3/cards_3/3": "Friends, is this really necessary? Olric's just having fun playing the game... he even bought us all dinner with his winnings last time.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_3/cards_3/4": "Besides, he couldn't possibly win a third time in a row... right?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_3/cards_3/5": "Hey uh, sorry I wasn't listening. Can anyone tell me what the difference between a regular flush and a royal flush is?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_3/cards_3/init": "We're in agreement, then?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_4/cards_4/1": "He must have a tell...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_4/cards_4/2": "I've been watching him in every game this whole season... his game face is flawless... it's like there's nothing going on behind those eyes!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_4/cards_4/3": "It's just a game, guys... don't get too hung up, you know?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_4/cards_4/4": "No Ryis, they're right... his ability to win is UNNATURAL...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_4/cards_4/5": "Drinks are on me, guys! By the way, anyone wanna see this four-leaf clover I found?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Cards/cards_4/cards_4/init": "I can't believe this... Olric won again."
