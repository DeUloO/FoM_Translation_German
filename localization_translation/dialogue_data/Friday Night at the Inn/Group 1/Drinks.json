    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/1": "Certainly... better to turn your senses to one thing and give it the attention it deserves. Isn't that right, young March?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/2": "[ARI]! Come here, c'mere... I'll let you in on a little secret. You're not so bad... Haha. Oh, what was I saying again?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/3": "Oh my... it seems our young blacksmith is a bit of a lightweight.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/4": "It's because he's drinking the cheap stuff... just like you, Valen. Having no palate is nothing to be ashamed of... here, try some of my wine. You'll see.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/5": "I suppose you've had plenty of time to refine your tastes, but as a doctor I simply can't recommend drinking at home, alone.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/6": "A girl can't get a little sloppy on a Monday night? This is why you have a reputation for being stiff, Valen.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/7": "I have a reputation...?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/8": "Come here and sit with me, [Ari]! The girls are fighting... what fun!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_1/drinkers_1/init": "These other folks and their games... I like to really sit with a drink and appreciate it, you know what I mean?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/1": "Juniper, I bought you some wine as a thank you for last time. Please, it's for you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/10": "Look at those two, getting along so well... bonding over a nice drink! That's what life's all about, if you ask me.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/11": "[Ari], do you think Juniper will let me try it? Maybe you can ask for me?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/2": "This is the most expensive bottle they keep behind the bar... It's not even on the menu.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/3": "Oh, did I not mention? My father was a bit of a sommelier. We used to have this vintage with dinner.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/4": "You did not. Mention that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/5": "Oh, how funny. Well, this is a dry wine, and aged in oak, so the taste is pleasantly full-bodied.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/6": "You might miss the sweetness, though- I've heard you have a bit of a sweettooth. One of those childish quirks that makes you so charming. Go on, give it a try.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/7": "IT'S... DELICIOUS... THANK YOU SO MUCH, THIS IS SO GENEROUS...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/8": "Oh, my pleasure.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/9": "I'll bet.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_2/drinkers_2/init": "Oh, [Ari]... you've arrived just in time for the show.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/1": "[Ari], you're here just in time! Juniper brought something truly special today... I've only heard stories about this wine.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/10": "I haven't seen anyone this humiliated since the Count of Thornbrook, and we all know what happened to him... and if you don't, I'll tell you later [Ari].",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/11": "O HO HO HO HO - ACK!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/12": "The bottle!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/13": "Juni knocked it over!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/14": "There it goes... all over the floor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/15": "......",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/16": "......",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/17": "I'd offer you some, but my cup is quite empty. Thank you for sharing, Juniper.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/18": "Correction- THIS is the most humiliated I've seen someone since the Count of Thornbrook...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/2": "Gather around, everyone... for a once in a century occasion.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/3": "This is Witchvine Merlot... an 800 year old vintage that I brought with me to Mistria.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/4": "Witchvine... Merlot...!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/5": "Oh, you've heard of it? I suppose with your background you've heard stories.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/6": "Yes, this is the real thing. And I think the first glass should go to Valen. For really opening my eyes to appreciating the finer things.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/7": "So... how is it? Don't hold back, doctor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/8": "It's... unbelievable... transcendent. I love it...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/9": "Well now. Isn't that nice?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_3/drinkers_3/init": "Sit with me, [Ari]! You're always so busy during the week...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/1": "Hoho! I shouldn't be getting rowdy at my age, but I'll have to show young March how we used to do things in my day!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/2": "What a sweet boy March is. Sigh... [Ari], I've been having my fun with the theatrics these past few weeks, but poor Juniper does seem to be a bit down this week...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/3": ".........",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/4": "It's not an 800 year old bottle of Witchvine Merlot, but I've got a bottle of red at home that tastes better with company.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/5": "I'm VERY busy, but... I could find a night that's open. Maybe.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/6": "Mm.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/7": "The blacksmith's choice of beer is uninspired, but... this swill does taste a little better than I thought.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/8": "It does, doesn't it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/9": "Cheers, Doctor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 1/Drinks/drinkers_4/drinkers_4/init": "Juni spilled her fancy wine last week... but it's the thought that counts, and she was thinking of all of us when she brought it! So this week... DRINKS ARE ON ME! AWOOOOOOO!"
