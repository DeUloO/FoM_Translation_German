    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/1": "Yaaaay!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/2": "A perfect place to introduce ourselves. I'm the scholar Aram, here to research the architectural secrets of the world!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/3": "Keeping it true to life, cool. I'm a birdwatcher by the name of Silver, seeking the legendary Dragonhawk! That's a hawk, not a dragon. Common misunderstanding.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/4": "A birdwatcher and a scholar... did anyone pick a combat class? For ascending the deadly Blood Tower?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/5": "Me! I'm a cool elf who's also a dragon and also a knight. My name is Brightclaw and I have a cool sword and claws and also my mom is here!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/6": "Ahem... yes, I'm Brightclaw's mother, a simple elvish trader... who negotiated a pact with a demon.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/7": "My name is Supreme Warlock Grimblade.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/8": "I'm beginning to understand where Dell's imagination comes from...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/init": "With Eiland's blessing, I'll be your host for a new adventure! Now, let's set the stage: you stand before an imposing gate, decorated with the bones and blood of fallen adventurers.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/1": "It's because we're on a journey... of knowledge!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/2": "No, it's because I like making friends with all the cool monsters! They told me I'm half-elf, half-dragon, half-knight, and secretly half-unicorn!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/3": "You might be the most magical creature of them all, Brightclaw. But your ma is an elf, so was your pa some kind of... Dragon Unicorn Knight?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/4": "Fascinating question. I'll roll for scholarly insight and draconic knowledge... oh rats, a three. Well, let's inquire with Brightclaw's mother. Grimblade?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/5": "I suppose I can ask. Holt, are you a Dragon Unicorn Knight?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/6": "Whatever you say, honey!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/init": "Your ragtag group has traveled three floors up the Blood Tower, inexplicably befriending every monster along the way. In fact, I don't think you've fought... anyone?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/1": "Silver is overcome with awe. He approaches reverently and coos, in the manner described in Daffodilia's Guide to Birds Strange and Mundane.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/10": "Oh no, you're not getting out of a fight this time. In fact, this parade of buffoonery enrages the Dragonhawk. Illusion falls away, revealing the Dragonhawk's true identity.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/11": "Demonlord Blood, who built this tower. An architect. An EVIL architect.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/12": "Gasp! My enemy!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/2": "The ancient bird heaves a deep, reverberating sigh. \"Oh dear,\" it says. \"Another fan.\" ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/3": "Wait what-",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/4": "Can I be friends with it? Can I pet it? I really want to pet it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/5": "Honey, it's a creature of ancient wisdom and power.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/6": "Besides, you don't know where that legendary bird has been.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/7": "The Dragonhawk hears your insinuations about its hygiene and has judged you... unworthy of giving pets. In fact, it seems quite angry, and begins to shimmer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/8": "Mooom! You made it angry!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/9": "Don't worry everyone, I'll enthrall this bird with the power of conversation. Aram recounts an architectural treatise on stoneworking, and-",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/init": "Revelations about Brightclaw's past bring you to the top of the tower, where you finally lay eyes upon it. The legendary Dragonhawk!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/1": "I've got him distracted, at least. He's the demon I made a pact with!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/10": "Ahem. \"You are the worst, most disorganized party to ever enter this tower, and I've paid the price for that. I hope my demise teaches you mortals something.\" ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/11": "I learned that Blood Tower is named for Lord Blood, and not because it's full of blood.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/12": "I learned that sometimes it's a mistake to meet your heroes, even if that hero is a bird.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/13": "I learned that knowledge can be a weapon! Literally!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/14": "I learned how to make a pact with a demon!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/2": "Apparently he's never met someone who knew the contract better than him!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/3": "Think, guys! That big arch he's sitting on is Alda style. Mister Aram said it relies on a keystone, but I can't hit something so far away!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/4": "Silver can do it. He's so let down by the Dragonhawk, this is his origin story... this is how he becomes a DARK BIRDWATCHER. I activate Shadow Eye and shoot the keystone!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/5": "A class change in the middle of battle? I'll allow it. The keystone shatters!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/6": "Demonlord Blood falls to the ground, trapped by his awkward conversation with Supreme Grimblade, made even more awkward by his graceless tumble.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/7": "I roll to show Demonlord Blood the pages of my architectural digest, hoping to turn him from the ways of evil architecture. I rolled a... twenty?!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/8": "The digest slips from your hand, striking Blood's weak spot. The demon coughs and begins to burn with demonic fire. He rasps his final words at you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/9": "Do the voice!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/init": "Friends, I must apologize... my eagerness to study the tower led to our capture by Demonlord Blood. Look at us now. Defeated. And we've learned nothing!"
