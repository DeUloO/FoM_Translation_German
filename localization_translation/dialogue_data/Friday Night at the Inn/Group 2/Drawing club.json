    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/1": "I joined the drawing club because I want to start sketching my animals. They grow up so fast, you know?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/2": "Valen's the model this week! I thought she'd be quite stiff, but she actually seems very comfortable in her poses.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/3": "An understanding of muscle groups is a must in my line of work. Now, are you ready? Next pose!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/4": "Wait, I'm still drawing! I can't create a masterpiece under these conditions.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/5": "It's not about creating a masterpiece, March! It's about having fun and spending time with your big bro!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/6": "It's not about being the best at drawing?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/7": "I see. So it's about being the best at having fun and hanging out.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/init": "Welcome to the first drawing club session of the season, [Ari]! We've got all kinds of talents here.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/1": "Between you and me, my back seized up ten minutes ago and now I'm stuck like this.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/2": "I heard that, and I'll take a look when we're done here. But for now, why don't we peek at everyone's drawings?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/3": "I like Landen's! You can see his carpenter's hand in it. Is it all those years of technical drawing, Landen?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/4": "You got me, lady. In case you're wondering, a clean line is all in the shoulder. Which I can see you've taken to heart, March! Big improvement!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/5": "Th-thanks. I mean, it's only natural, right? And speaking of natural, Valen... your drawings are something else.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/6": "Oh, thank you March. I was just thinking that Elsie's portraits are so striking. She really draws out the... charm points of her subject.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/7": "Are my pecs really that big?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/8": "Did you do some drawing down on the farm, big guy? The baby animals in your sketchbook are WAY cute.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/9": "I wanted a memento from when they're tiny! These drawings are nothing special... not as special as I'd like. Now, can someone get some ice for my back?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/init": "I'm the model this week! You might be wondering how can I hold this pose for so long...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/1": "My drawings are pretty bad, but I'll try to do you justice, Elsie!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/2": "Hayden, if I could point something out. I noticed you've got a habit of putting your own drawings down.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/3": "You avoid sharing them, too... It's important to take pride in what you do.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/4": "Aaand?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/5": "And to have fun, too. I guess.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/6": "My goodness, March. As a doctor, I'm afraid I have to diagnose you with a growth... of character.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/7": "What you're all saying is tough medicine, but don't think I'm not taking it to heart! If even stubborn young March can change, then your ol' friend Hayden can too.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/8": "Yeah, exactly!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/9": "Hey, wait a minute...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/init": "I'm having such fun being this week's model, [Ari]! Between performing in the opera and walking the red carpet, I'm no stranger to striking a pose!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/1": "Thanks, I put a lot of work into my traps! Okay, I better make way for this week's real model.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/2": "Cluck cluck!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/3": "I like your attitude, young lady. And what a lovely pose... you're giving us so much wing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/4": "How is Henrietta such a dynamic model?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/5": "Thanks for sharing this with us, Hayden. Seems awful special to you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/6": "I've seen so many animals grow up since I took the farm over. Thought it might be nice to start sketching up some memories.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/7": "Before I knew it, I was sketching all by myself and got in my own head about it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/8": "Thanks for talking some sense into me! You reminded me I'm the sharing type, and drawing's more fun with friends besides. Isn't that right, [Ari]?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/9": "GYA HA HA!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/init": "Excellent contrapposto, Olric!"
