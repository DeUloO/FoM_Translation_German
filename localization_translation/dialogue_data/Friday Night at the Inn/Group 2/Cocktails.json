    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/1": "Ahahaha... since you mention it, I was in the middle of documenting quality control standards... which I should probably get back to...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/2": "Sorry to see you go. How about one drink before you hit the road?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/3": "Oh, that tastes just heavenly! Try this, [Ari]!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/4": "Hot, sweet and fruity, with a little bite... that's whiskey, I surmise?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/5": "It's like hot tea with a little something extra! More of that extra for me, please.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/6": "I want to wrap myself up in this drink like a blanket, it's so cozy! What is it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/7": "Hot toddy. Hot water, lemon, honey, and a splash of whatever you like. Thought something simple after a complicated week was just the thing.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/8": "Maybe you're right. And you know, I think it's very important I quality control this drink.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/9": "That'd be mighty helpful of you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/init": "Ohhh, I know that look, Adeline, you're thinking of going back to work! Keep your behind parked in that chair!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/1": "I'm overrun with mint this year! Hayden called it a bumper crop. I brought more, take it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/2": "Nice, I can pretty up drinks with the fresh stuff. And... there we are, mint gimlets all around. Give them a go!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/3": "Oh! It's so cute! And green! And it tastes so minty! And herby!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/4": "And fresh! And limey!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/5": "Hemlock used to mix me one of these after a long, hot day in the Mines. Oh, happy days... no matter the time of year, this is the taste of summer!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/6": "It's so refreshing! This drink and I were mint to be together.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/7": "Thanks to Celine, I've got it bottled up behind the counter now, so come back for the taste of summer any time. You too, [Ari]!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/init": "Thanks for bringing all that mint by earlier this week, Celine. Reina cooked it down and got a nice syrup out of it, so we've got something special today.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/1": "I know you're a coffee fan, so I've been experimenting since last time I saw Darcy at the Market. Took weeks to get the flavor right!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/10": "Not even a pun? Now that's a first.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/2": "Now, we've got two to one of our base liquor and the coffee liqueur, over ice. That's a nice molasses color, isn't it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/3": "It looks a bit... bitter. Unless...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/4": "You know it. Reina whipped up some sweet heavy cream for us. Now, a big, generous ladle on top...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/5": "Oh my gosh. It looks scrumptious!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/6": "You're an artist, Hemlock. Cheers!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/7": "Look at the cream blend with the coffee! It looks like a heavy mist over the mountains...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/8": "Now that's a pretty name. We'll call it a Heavy Mist! So, what do you think Holt?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/9": "Can't! Talk! Too... busy... drinking!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/init": "You absolute madman. You did it. Coffee liqueur!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/1": "This is something we used to make after a long day in the Mines. It went by many names! Rock Juice, the Mineshaft, Blood from the Stone, the Sinkhole...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/10": "Oh, you're all giving up in favor a normal drink? That's how we did it in the old days, too.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11": "What about you, [Ari]? You can have a beer, but someone's got to, ah, handle this Bucket Brew.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11/prompts/0": "Bucket Brew me!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11/prompts/1": "I'll stick with beer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/12": "Hoho, you're an adventurous one! That's the spirit!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/13": "You've wisdom beyond your years, [Ari].",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/2": "Helmet Hash, Miner's Mash, Bucket Brew...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/3": "So what was the recipe?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/4": "Well, it wasn't a recipe so much as we all poured whatever dregs we had into a canteen and gave it a good shake!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/5": "Errol, as the one responsible for the wellbeing of this town, I have to ask. What was safer, the Mines or this drink?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/6": "Hah! You're quite a card, Lady Adeline.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/7": "He didn't answer the question, did he?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/8": "He sure didn't...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/9": "How about a round of beers instead?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/init": "Hemlock's been so generously mixing the drinks the past few weeks, I thought I'd share a recipe of my own!"
