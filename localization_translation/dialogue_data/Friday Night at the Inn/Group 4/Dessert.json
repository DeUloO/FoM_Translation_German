    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/2": "I can tell you, I've traveled far and wide, and I've never seen fluffier cream than this!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/3": "And the berries! That zing! Did you forage these yourself, Hayden?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/4": "Sure did! With a helping hand... er, wing from Henrietta! So what do you think, [Ari]? Pretty good, right?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/4/prompts/0": "It's SO good!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/4/prompts/1": "Is this one of Mistria's signature desserts?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/5": "Even I have to admit it's pretty good.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/6": "I'd say so.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/7": "Speaking of which, where'd the funding for this dessert club come from?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/8": "We have a mysterious benefactor! One who would prefer to remain anonymous.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/9": "More berries, I say! More cream!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_1/dessert_1/init": "Oh, I am so excited for this! Welcome everyone! We'll be indulging in a new dessert every week.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/1": "Oh... what a unique texture! The cake is fluffy and light, pierced by the sharpness of the fruit!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/2": "Oh, I am a fan of this one! The fruit is somehow sweet and savory. I wouldn't mind making a jam of it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/3": "Would this be better with coffee or sweet tea?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/3/prompts/0": "Coffee!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/3/prompts/1": "Sweet Tea!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/4": "Bitter and sweet always compliment each other, don't they?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/5": "Just what I was thinking! A perfect afternoon snack.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/6": "Did you dry the fruits before baking them in? I like it. A lot more tart than I would have thought.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/7": "That's right! I was trying to recreate the cake Terithia remembered. She did a good job describing the tastes and textures.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/8": "I hope I can do as good a job describing it to Nora! There's no way my piece is making it home!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_2/dessert_2/init": "I was far from Mistria the first time I was offered a slice of $Moon Fruit Cake$, and it's always stuck with me.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/11": "We're all very proud of you, Eiland.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/2": "He's mad! Salt? In dessert?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/3": "I've salted fish, but on watermelon? I wonder.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/3/prompts/0": "Salt makes sweet flavors more balanced, doesn't it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/3/prompts/1": "March is ruining dessert for everyone!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/4": "That's right, [Ari]! Darcy and I both use salt in most of our baked goods.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/5": "I guess this is what I get for trying something new.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/6": "We grew up putting salt on our watermelon! According to Valen, both salt and watermelon replenish your electrolytes. Great on a hot summer's day!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/7": "At first I was with Eiland, but have you tried it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/8": "It's so sweet it's making my mustache spin!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/9": "Fine, I'll try it...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_3/dessert_3/init": "Listen up! This is the March takeover of the dessert club. This time we're eating something I've been meaning to try...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/1": "I can't believe I kept a lid on it! I've been gathering the best of the best ingredients from my farm, so this week we're having...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/10": "That's it for dessert club, you guys! Now, I think we'd better leave Eiland alone with the rest of these cookies.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/11": "It's going to be a disaster.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/2": "$Golden Cookies$! Fresh out of the oven!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/3": "Golden... cookies? The cookies made from only the most perfect of ingredients? The cookies that bring us closest to the divine?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/4": "Someone catch Eiland, he looks like he's going to faint from happiness!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/4/prompts/0": "I'll catch him!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/4/prompts/1": "The only thing I'm catching are these cookies!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/5": "Thank you, and apologies [Ari].",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/6": "We are of a mind, [Ari]!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/7": "One for Dell, and one for me, and one for Dell, and one for me...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/8": "Hmm, yeah. It's pretty good, for a cookie.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/9": "The richness of top-shelf eggs and butter meld to create a chewiness that melts in your mouth. Superb!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Dessert/dessert_4/dessert_4/init": "I think Hayden's been fit to burst keeping this week's dessert a secret!"
