    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_darcy_2/market_darcy_2/init": "Darcy's coffee runs out quickly, so don't be shy... you wouldn't want to be latte to the party.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_darcy_3/market_darcy_3/init": "[Ari], are you here to try some of Darcy's coffees? They're fa-brew-lous!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_darcy_4/market_darcy_4/init": "Last time Dell got coffee, it resulted in... The Incident. Let me tell you, it caused a latte problems!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_louis_1/market_louis_1/init": "Louis is always teasing my choice of footwear, but dads in sandals are a time-honored tradition. Anything else would be sandal-ous.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_louis_2/market_louis_2/1": "Because he believes in sole mates!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_louis_2/market_louis_2/init": "Hey [Ari], you know why Louis makes his shoes in pairs?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_louis_3/market_louis_3/init": "Louis can design, sew and knit... he's a triple thread.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_louis_4/market_louis_4/1": "Who knew fashion designers were so clothes-minded?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_louis_4/market_louis_4/init": "I'm always giving Louis ideas for new clothing, but he always ignores me.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_merri_1/market_merri_1/init": "Jo's always buying up all of Merri's restored furniture... I keep telling her there are already plenty of places to sit at the Inn, but she couldn't chair less.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_merri_2/market_merri_2/init": "Merri's got a new bed frame for sale... Nora says ours is good enough, but I like this one bedder...",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_merri_3/market_merri_3/init": "Nora wants a new desk for her accounting... that's quite understan-table.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_merri_4/market_merri_4/init": "[Ari], I'm gonna shoot straight with you... Merri's got great couches and I've got a great pun about being king of them, but Nora forbade me to say it.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_stillwell_1/market_stillwell_1/init": "You know, [Ari], I almost became a psychic myself. I gave it up, though... couldn't see any future in it.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_stillwell_2/market_stillwell_2/init": "The number of customers Stillwell gets is impressive... he surely makes a tidy prophet.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_stillwell_3/market_stillwell_3/init": "Stillwell is always muttering about darkness or wailing about darkness... he's never a happy medium.",

    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_vera_2/market_vera_2/1": "Luckily Vera's handy with a razor. She really shaved me some trouble!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_vera_2/market_vera_2/init": "I tried to grow a beard, but Nora didn't like it...",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_vera_3/market_vera_3/1": "She knows all the short cuts. Long cuts, too, if you prefer the scenic route!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_vera_3/market_vera_3/init": "If you need a haircut or you need directions, Vera's got you covered...",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_vera_4/market_vera_4/1": "Would you believe it, it turned orange!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_vera_4/market_vera_4/init": "I once had Vera bleach my hair...",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_wheedle_1/market_wheedle_1/init": "Nora said I should try skipping through the meadow instead of spending my money at Wheedle's. I don't see how that's going to fix my gamboling problem.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_wheedle_2/market_wheedle_2/init": "I think Wheedle might be a vampire, [Ari]. He always gets nervous when I raise the stakes.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Holt/Market Lines/market_wheedle_3/market_wheedle_3/init": "I won an antique clock with no hands... it's a timeless treasure!",
