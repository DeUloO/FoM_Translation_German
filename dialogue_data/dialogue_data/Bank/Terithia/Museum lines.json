    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/aldarian_war_banner/aldarian_war_banner/init": "Amazing that you found that $Aldarian War Banner$. Saw the old thing while Errol was putting it out.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/alligator_gar/alligator_gar/1": "The Gar's scales are tough enough to be arrowheads. That was how I survived until rescue came. Been fond of the Alligator Gar ever since.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/alligator_gar/alligator_gar/init": "The $Alligator Gar$ at the museum had me thinking back to my time on a deserted island.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/cave_eel/cave_eel/1": "An eel's an eel, after all.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/cave_eel/cave_eel/init": "I was admiring that $Cave Eel$ you hauled over to the museum. They're blind, but they're still pretty tricky to catch!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/cherry_fish/cherry_fish/1": "You've done this fisherwoman a boon, letting me see it with my own eyes!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/cherry_fish/cherry_fish/init": "I'd heard stories of the $Cherry Fish$, but I never knew what it looked like until I saw it at the museum. So little, so beautiful, so pink!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/fossilized_egg/fossilized_egg/1": "I'm just wondering what a prehistoric scramble tastes like.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/fossilized_egg/fossilized_egg/init": "That $Fossilized Egg$ you found. Would Errol be cross if I ate it?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/giant_koi/giant_koi/1": "It took a hundred long years to reach the top, and in recognition of the feat, the koi was blessed and turned into a dragon!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/giant_koi/giant_koi/2": "I wouldn't go around asking any dragons if they were formerly fish, though.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/giant_koi/giant_koi/init": "It's a funny feeling, seeing a $Giant Koi$ immortalized at the museum like that. Brings to mind an old story about the koi who leapt up a waterfall.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/grouper/grouper/1": "My my, that was a large one. You've got guts!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/grouper/grouper/init": "[Ari]! That $Grouper$ that Errol's got on display, that was your catch?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/leaf_fish/leaf_fish/1": "And to think, it was in Mistria this whole time! It's a good feeling, knowing there's still new critters to catch!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/leaf_fish/leaf_fish/init": "I'd only heard tales of the $Leaf Fish$ until I saw it at the museum, [Ari]. Where'd you find such a legend?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/lightining_fish/lightning_fish/1": "So you're storm fishing, eh, [Ari]? I won't stop you, but keep on your toes!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/lightining_fish/lightning_fish/init": "A $Lightning Fish$! At the museum! My old commander said you can only catch them in the middle of a summer storm.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/mines_mussels/mines_mussels/1": "I wonder if they're as tasty as the regular kind?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/mines_mussels/mines_mussels/init": "Errol's got those little $Mines Mussels$ on display at the museum.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/mini_whale_shark/mini_whale_shark/1": "The Mini-Whale Shark is still pretty big, though.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/mini_whale_shark/mini_whale_shark/init": "That $Mini-Whale Shark$ at the museum sure is cute! Well, compared to a regular-size whale shark.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/paddlefish/paddlefish/1": "They used to say the paddle was for digging, but it's not the case! A sea scholar told me that.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/paddlefish/paddlefish/init": "I spied a $Paddlefish$ at the museum and figured that was your doing. What a funny-looking creature.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/pebble_minnow/pebble_minnow/1": "It's a big wide world, ain't it!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/pebble_minnow/pebble_minnow/init": "I've never seen a fish like that $Pebble Minnow$ at the museum. It came from a cave deep beneath the earth?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/rock_guppy/rock_guppy/init": "There's a $Rock Guppy$ at the museum, was that your doing? I'm impressed! Most folks can't tell the difference between a Rock Guppy and the regular kind.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/rusted_shield/rusted_shield/1": "That coat of arms isn't familiar to me, though. I suppose it's a big wide world, eh [Ari]?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/rusted_shield/rusted_shield/init": "That $Rusted Shield$ in the Sunken Antiquities area of the museum brings back memories.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/shadow_bass/shadow_bass/init": "The $Shadow Bass$ doesn't always live up to such an imposing name, but you certainly caught a fine specimen for the museum!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/shark/shark/1": "You're brave to reel that one in! And strong to boot.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/shark/shark/init": "My eyes about jumped out of my head when I saw that $Shark$ you caught at the museum.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/snow_fish/snow_fish/1": "Now THAT is something. Sounds like I've got a new winter goal! KYA HA HA!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/snow_fish/snow_fish/init": "There's a $Snow Fish$ at the museum, [Ari]! You caught the real thing? Here in Mistria?",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/tidestone/tidestone/1": "Thinking of having a little slice of ocean in my home warms the cockles of my heart!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/tidestone/tidestone/init": "That $Tidestone$ at the museum bewitched me, [Ari].",

    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/trilobite_fossil/trilobite_fossil/init": "That $Trilobite Fossil$ at the museum takes me back!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/underseaweed/underseaweed/1": "Less of that briny kick!",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/underseaweed/underseaweed/init": "Did you take a bite out of that $Underseaweed$ before you turned it over to Errol? It's got a milder taste than your average seaweed.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/white_perch/white_perch/1": "It's good you registered it with the museum, though. Better to have a record of everything, nuisances included.",
    "Conversations/Bank/Terithia/Museum Lines/white_perch/white_perch/init": "$White Perch$ is a bit of a nuisance as fish go! They eat up the eggs of other fish."
