    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/1": "Who in Mistria would survive on a deserted island?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/10": "I suppose. Mostly I'm just glad it's not me on a deserted island.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/2": "Terithia! What a question! Let's see...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/3": "Balor enjoys his luxuries far too much, so he wouldn't last a day. Eiland, too. Our lord would expire without a slice of cake before bedtime.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/4": "Oh, they might surprise you. But I wouldn't say either is my first pick.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/5": "Holt would simply perish if he didn't have someone else to hear his jokes. On the other hand, Adeline would have the island organized in short order.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/6": "Aye, that girl's no stranger to rolling up her sleeves. What do you think, [Ari]? Anyone in mind?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/6/prompts/0": "Reina! She can make a meal out of anything!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/6/prompts/1": "Hayden! He's so self-reliant!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/7": "My thoughts exactly.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/8": "Unlike me, [Ari]. Can you imagine, ME on a deserted island? I would simply give up.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/9": "He's like you, isn't he? He'd have some crops going and animals befriended before the week was out.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/init": "Juniper, [Ari]! Let me ask you a question...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1_follow_up_hayden/1": "Is that their way of telling me I should take a vacation?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1_follow_up_hayden/init": "Juniper and Terithia flagged me down earlier, asking how I'd cultivate a deserted island.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1_follow_up_reina/1": "Anyway, I gave them Papa's tropical punch recipe and they seemed really happy!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1_follow_up_reina/init": "Juniper and Terithia have been asking for island recipes. Are they going on vacation?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/1": "It's a perfectly normal thing to wonder about! Who in Mistria would make the best frog?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/10": "I haven't had enough wine for this conversation.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/11": "Oh. Yes. It seems so obvious when you put it like that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/12": "It really fits, doesn't it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/13": "But I've got our real answer. It's Errol! Have you seen that man's legs in a bathing suit?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/2": "March would run through all his energy trying to jump higher than the other frogs. Landen would croak up a storm and drive the rest off.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/3": "What about Ryis? He seems the type to be content with the simple life.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/4": "He's a city boy, Juniper. No frogs in the city.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/5": "Surely you've got some thoughts, [Ari]! Who do you think would make the best frog?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/5/prompts/0": "Juniper! The bathhouse is like your pond!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/5/prompts/1": "Olric! He loves sitting on rocks!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/6": "KYA HA HA!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/7": "I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, [Ari].",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/8": "Now now, I think you'd make an adorable little frog. One of those poisonous ones.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/9": "Besides, we all know the real answer. It has to be Errol! Have you seen that man's legs in a bathing suit?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/init": "Ahoy there, [Ari]! Help me answer Juniper's strange question.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/1": "You wouldn't happen to know why, would you?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/2": "Ah, I can tell by your expression that I shouldn't pursue the matter further.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/init": "[Ari], I couldn't help but notice that Terithia and Juniper were both pointing at me the other night.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/1": "Who here would make the best pirate?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/2": "Oho, I was born to answer this question. Errol would look dashing with a tricorn hat, but he gets a tad seasick. Hemlock strikes me as a right salty dog.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/3": "And Nora would make a fearful captain, but a fair one. Oh, it's difficult to choose!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/4": "March has that look in his eye that says everyone is his enemy. He might even pull off an eyepatch.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5": "What do you think, [Ari]?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5/prompts/0": "Dell, Maple and Luc! They play pirates all the time.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5/prompts/1": "Elsie! She'd plunder everyone's hearts!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/6": "I have to throw in with [Ari] on this one, Terithia. They're half pirate already!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/7": "Mistria's original rapscallions.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/8": "She does have a heart of adventure.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/9": "She'd be the siren of the sea! No one could resist her charms.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/init": "Now Terithia, I've put a lot of thought into this question, so I hope you'll take it seriously. Same to you, [Ari].",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_elsie/1": "I can't say I have, but there's always time.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_elsie/init": "Juniper asked if I'd ever romanced a pirate, and Terithia asked me the same thing later.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_kids/1": "Well, I'm adorable, and Dell would make a great pirate.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_kids/2": "Arrrrr matey!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_kids/init": "Juniper said we would make adorable pirates.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/1": "Sorcerers? That's a fairy tale, Juniper.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/10": "Hmm. Bet he could.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/11": "I can see it. She has a curious mind, and an eye for herbs, which are two of the basic tenets of potion-making.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/12": "But I frankly don't think she could pull off the wardrobe.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/13": "Hmm. Bet she could.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/2": "Of course, of course. But Terithia, we proposed starting a pirate crew last week! Work with me here.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/3": "Fair enough. Let's see now, Eiland's read a lot of old books about the Witch Queens... but I'd say that's where his interest ends.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/4": "March has a knack for creating things, but he's a bit rigid otherwise.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/5": "Josephine does give me pause. She has a way of moving through the world.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/6": "What about Valen?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7": "I won't even dignify that with a response. [Ari], speak up! Your thoughts are wanted. And no picking yourself!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7/prompts/0": "Hayden! Henrietta is like his familiar!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7/prompts/1": "Celine! The way her flowers bloom is magical!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/8": "Interesting. And I do see it. He has a strong connection to his animals, and a connection to the land as well.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/9": "But I frankly don't think he could pull off the wardrobe.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/init": "My, look at all those people down there. We've got a full house. I wonder which of them would make the best sorcerer?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_celine/1": "I think she agreed a little too quickly, though!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_celine/init": "Juniper asked if I wanted her old hand-me-downs. I told her thank you, but they're not really my style...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_hayden/1": "When I asked if she wanted to be MY assistant, she looked like she might faint! Well, I doubt she has the shoes for it anyway.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_hayden/init": "Juniper asked if I wanted to become her assistant! I said no, of course, I'm too busy with the farm."
