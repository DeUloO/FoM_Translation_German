    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/1": "Oh no. That's a clown, and I know that look in your eye. You're trying to foist off some junk you found while making it sound like a gift.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/2": "I don't know about that. The frame's not junk, at least. This wood is pretty rare. You'd have to import it at great cost.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/3": "The frame is gilded, too! That's extravagant... and a bit odd, for a painting of a clown.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/4": "The paints are definitely high-quality. See how the red of his nose is still so vibrant? You can't get the ingredients for that kind of vermillion easily.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/5": "And look at this, on the margin. I recognize the artist's signature. She was known to be commissioned by the nobility of the era.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/6": "Huh.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/7": "Thank you for this priceless painting, Balor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/8": "Now now, let's not be hasty! There's more to this than any of us thought, myself included.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/9": "Let's reconvene this... detective's club next week, so we can properly solve the mystery of the painting!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_1/detectives_1/init": "It's a nice antique painting, isn't it? It's got... character. And it's my gift to you, Nora!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/1": "Me either. I asked Eiland to look up the artist, and it turns out she did almost three hundred portraits during her life, mostly for nobility.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/10": "That's... very mysterious.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/11": "You don't suppose that this clown is... an immortal creature of the night?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/2": "There's something about the subject... underneath all the clown makeup, he almost seems familiar.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/3": "I was thinking the same thing... odd, that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/4": "That's quite unlikely. The painting is over two hundred years old!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/5": "Do you suppose this clown is some kind of... immortal creature of the night?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/6": "That's Dell talk. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Celine.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/7": "Hm, there's something about this joint in the frame... oh!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/8": "It's a sliding panel! There's a slip of paper inside... I'll read it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/9": "\"Do I tell the truth or do I lie? Mine true nature I must deny. If revealed, 'twould gain naught but scorn. My true name is... \" It ends there.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_2/detectives_2/init": "I tell you, this clown is haunting me. After the detective club's observations last week, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this painting.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/1": "I dug further into the artist, and though she did many portraits, she did most of them for three noble families: The Wainscotts, The Meridians, and The Hawthornes.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/2": "I'm familiar with all those names, though the Wainscott name ended when the last daughter of the line married into another house.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/3": "\"If revealed, 'twould gain naught but scorn. My true name is... \" ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/4": "Lord Hawthorne!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/5": "Of course! Hawthorne is a famous name in the Capital. You see their faces on campaign posters a few times a year!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/6": "That explains why the clown looks so familiar! I think we're onto something!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/7": "I'll contact the family to verify the truth. If we return the painting, perhaps we'll get a nice reward for reuniting them with a beloved heirloom!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/8": "One question remains, though... why a clown?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_3/detectives_3/init": "This painting is mesmerizing me. There's something about the clown's eyes. Like he's torn between two worlds.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/1": "The good news is that we solved the mystery! This painting was indeed commissioned by the late Lord Hawthorne.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/10": "All yours, [Ari]. This clown was giving me nightmares.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/11": "Great. Let's bury it somewhere... funny. I think Hawthorne would have liked that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/12": "A mystery well-solved, everyone! Congratulations.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/13": "No kidding! I'm impressed with all of you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/14": "And now I know exactly who to call next time I have a hideous, unsellable painting on my hands.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/2": "He was a politician who moonlighted as a clown... his true passion.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/3": "We did it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/4": "And the bad news?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/5": "The family is aware of the painting... and despises it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/6": "Oh. I suppose his descendants want nothing to do with their clownish history...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/7": "So... what do we do with it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/8": "Well, the Hawthornes said it was a political liability. They want it destroyed.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9": "I don't have the heart to do that, but maybe we can bury it. I'll get a shovel.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9/prompts/0": "Wait! I'll take it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9/prompts/1": "That's probably for the best.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/init": "Good evening, my detectives! I come bearing good news and bad news."
