    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/1": "Each of you is here to vie for a chance to become my heir and one day rule over all of Aldaria!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/10": "Aww, come on Reina!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/11": "Hmm, Reina already has my vote. Too bad this isn't a voting game.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/12": "As long as we can still be friends afterward, I guess Lord Beetle is ready to unleash his million strong bug army!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/13": "That's the spirit!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/2": "Of course, anyone who DOESN'T become my heir might be put to death, if reading old history books has taught me anything.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/3": "But that's how royalty does it! Who are we to argue with a system of rule thousands of years old!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/4": "Now would the members of my court please introduce themselves?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/5": "I'm Lord Beetle. Maple, do we really have to be put to death if we lose? I don't wanna do that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/6": "Ah shucks, little guy! I think Maple-, er Queen Maple, is just setting the tone. Lord Hayword wouldn't harm his fellow courtiers.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/7": "I'm Lord Anvilstrike, and the Queen is right. Only ignominy and death await my foes on the road to becoming heir.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/8": "Well, maybe just exile... or some community service hours.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/9": "I'm Lady Kettle, sister to the Queen. If I win this contest, all your lives will be spared!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/init": "Hear ye, hear ye, welcome to Queen Maple's game of Succession!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/1": "Lady Kettle's armies are routed, her war engines lie in ruins...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/10": "Now we're talking!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/2": "I shouldn't have picked all those cicadas for my army, they don't even have mouths.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/3": "Aldaria is going to be in a sorry state if any of you get put in charge!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/4": "W-well, maybe by ourselves isn't the way to go about it! What if we all joined forces, for the good of the country?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/5": "Lord Hayword, please stop trying to undermine the iron grip of my rule.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/6": "He does have a point though...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/7": "If only my dependable Lord Anvilstrike hadn't rolled a 1 and accidentally fallen down all those stairs.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/8": "If Lord Anvilstrike regrets anything, it's that he only had one life to lay down for Aldaria.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/9": "Well, maybe your Queen can revive you. But just this once!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/init": "Wow, you all are REALLY bad at rolling dice. Sheesh!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/1": "Don't give them hope, Queen Maple. My ascension is a forgone conclusion! ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/10": "And what role will your QUEEN be playing in all of this, pray tell? ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/11": "Aw shucks, you can still be Queen! We'll just need to make sure this new group agrees with your decisions.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/2": "I keep telling you all, we need to band together. I roll a 19 for persuasion!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/3": "Lord Hayword, I'll allow it, but this had better lead to some betrayal MOST foul.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/4": "Lord Beetle agrees with Lord Hayword! We should form a group of concerned citizens with Mistria's best interests at heart.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/5": "Well, my armies are mostly out of commission, I suppose Lady Kettle is willing to aid her fellow court members.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/6": "Honestly, running a country by yourself seems like a lot of work. Anvilstrike is... Anvil-in.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/7": "I think we have consensus!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/8": "We should probably have more than just nobility on this council though, huh? As it is, we're all thumbs.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/9": "What if we invite merchants? And commoners!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/init": "With Lord Anvilstrike's revival, his prowess on the battlefield has shown through. You're all going to need to try a lot harder or he's going to end up my heir.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/1": "Are you all SURE you all don't want to fight to the death instead?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/10": "At any rate, thanks for playing my- er, OUR game, everyone.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/2": "I think your councilors are set on this new path forward, your highness.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/3": "We did it! It's a brand new day for Aldaria! ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/4": "Isn't everything better when we all work together?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/5": "It definitely changed the game though, huh?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/6": "Maybe I can arrange some war games with the Caldosians.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/7": "I shouldn't have let the Queen tack on that rider ensuring new species are named after her...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/8": "Well now, I think the \"Monarch Maplefly\" has a nice ring to it, don't you?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/9": "Definitely.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/init": "Okay okay, so my face will be on the money, there will be two national holidays celebrating me every year, and no paperwork, right?"
