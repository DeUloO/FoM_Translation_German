    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/1": "Lords of the Land... Hm. Can't say I'm familiar with it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/2": "It was locked in a chest, which was a bit odd. Anyway, all of the pieces were present and accounted for.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/3": "Do you suppose we could play it? It might open up a whole new avenue of research.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/4": "So we each pick a game piece to represent us on the board? Oh, I want the flower!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/5": "It's a daffodil, Mom. And really? That... that's my game piece! That's me!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/6": "I suppose I'll be the jester's cap.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/7": "Now Eiland, if there's a jester around these parts, it would be yours truly.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/8": "When was the last time you even cracked a joke?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/9": "Hm. Perhaps there was a reason this game was locked up...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/init": "I found an old board game in the museum archives! Look at this.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/1": "What's riveting is the fact that Eiland is buying up all this property and then sitting on it! Surely you can find a use for your empire?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/10": "I wonder if there's more to Lords of the Land than we think.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/2": "But I have, Nora! It's my duty to preserve these historical buildings. I'm leaving them intact.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/3": "But you had it all declared landmarks! No one has any place to live!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/4": "That's why Celine and I pooled our black market bucks to get around the law. You see, Eiland may have bought the buildings, but I bought the deeds to the land.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/5": "I'm going to level it to make room for my newest development... an amusement park!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/6": "Welcome... to Holtland.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/7": "You said we'd call it Celineland!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/8": "For a silly little board game, it certainly induces people to act unlike themselves.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/9": "It raises the collective blood pressure of the table, too...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/init": "This game is riveting, Eiland. You said it's called Lords of the Land?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/1": "Apparently this game is outlawed in seven countries, four provinces and two city-states. It has a storied history of turning neighbor against neighbor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/10": "This has been simply fascinating. I wonder if I might take the game home with me?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/11": "I'd love to study it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/2": "Of course, we live in more civilized times, so no need to let that ruin the fun!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/3": "Fun? FUN? You think the woodworker's district burning down in the last game was fun?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/4": "It only burned down because you were courting the reformed thieves guild in hopes of swindling them out of their property.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/5": "Instead, they came after you! For revenge!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/6": "We don't take kindly to being tricked, Dad. You should have taken the deal. It was an honest offer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/7": "Actually, it was a bit outrageous as offers go... you overvalued that real estate at least twice over.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/8": "We're a reformed thieves guild, Eiland... not fools.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/9": "Do you take us for fools, Eiland?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/init": "I uncovered some interesting facts about Lords of the Land in the past week!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/1": "It's true! Reina really outdid herself. And Eiland, this tea is so lovely and floral! Thank you for sharing it with us.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/2": "Of course! Good things are meant to be shared.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/3": "Weren't we playing a board game, though?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/4": "That's right! Lords of the Land. Didn't Valen take it home last time?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/5": "I threw it in the river.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/6": "You threw a historical artifact... in the river?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/7": "It seemed the best place for it. And look at us! We're all getting along quite nicely.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/8": "But Valen... what happens when it washes up in the next town over?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/9": "It'll tear that village apart!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/init": "These shortcakes are delicious, Celine."
