    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/1": "Now, let's introduce our first book! Terithia picked Tales of the Sea, a collection of fishy folktales. Tell me about your favorite story!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/2": "I quite liked the Ballad of the Sea Cucumber. For a story with such an adorable premise, the sense of melancholy at the close is what made it stick out in my mind.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/3": "Oh yeah, I liked that one. My favorite was the one about the three pirates. I had no idea who was going to end up captain in the end!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/4": "To be frank, I've been on ships like that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/5": "KYA HA HA!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/6": "I was partial to the Siren's Song story! I could relate, I'm not immune to a charming face and a pretty ditty!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/7": "You'd walk right into the ocean, I suspect.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/8": "Lucky for me I'm such a strong swimmer!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/init": "Oh, it is so exciting to welcome you to book club! I ran one in the Capital, too... I find discussion helps stimulate my mind as I formulate my memoirs!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/1": "I've been dying to talk about this book all week! I started reading right after our last session, and I couldn't put it down! The twists! The turns!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/2": "I love a closed room mystery, and setting it on a ship was so cool.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/3": "When they said the first murder happened on the deck, where it was impossible to hide... I was captivated. I started keeping a journal!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/4": "Then Ryis and I got to talking about it, and we started pinning notes to the wall in my room. I woke up and went to sleep staring at that thing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/5": "I was a man possessed! I couldn't figure it out!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/6": "The writer also had all the little nautical details down pat. The absentee pennant, the fake murder weapon hidden in the bilge, the landlubber knots being a clue...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/7": "It was very convincing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/8": "And who would have thought the butler was the murderer? Not me! But it all made sense...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/init": "Oh, I can't wait! Let's get this book club started! What did you think of Murder on the Grand Leviathan?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/1": "Yes... unique... rarely have I seen a book written with such, ah... deliberate precision.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/2": "But the diagrams! Illustrations were a welcome addition.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/3": "I thought the author's note at the end was rather romantic. In his heart, he dedicated that building to his wife.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/4": "Even if he was rather dry about it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/5": "See, Ryis? What'd I tell you? We spent a whole summer bonding over that book, and now they're appreciating it too!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/6": "Uncle, it's a technical manual for reconstructing a wooden cathedral... I don't think this is the kind of book Elsie was talking about. Sorry guys, I tried to talk him out of it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/7": "I did enjoy rereading it, though...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/init": "So, ah... Landen and Ryis' choice of book was a bit unique, don't ya think?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/1": "The Rise and Fall of House Amore. What a story!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/10": "Would it be too forward to ask for mine to be signed?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/2": "I'll say! This is what book club is all about! Though I don't know how I feel about Ryis reading about all that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/3": "What are you even talking about? It was hardly lurid.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/4": "Listen to you! In my day that chapter twelve hand-holding scene would have meant a content warning on the cover!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/5": "Anyway! I love a good love triangle. And this one was so good. I really didn't know which way the princess would go!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/6": "The maelstrom of feelings I had at the end! The joy of love realized! The heart, crushed to pieces!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/7": "Aw, you big old softie.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/8": "Elsie, aren't you writing a romance novel? Let's have a special session when it's ready!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/9": "I'm actually writing my memoirs, so there are many romances to speak of. I'm so delighted you're interested! When I'm done, you'll all get a free copy!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/init": "I'm not one for lovey-dovey stuff, but the book you picked was a real shipsinker, Elsie!"
