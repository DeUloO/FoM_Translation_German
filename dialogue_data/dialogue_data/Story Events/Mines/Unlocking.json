    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/14": "I hate to cut and run so soon, but this is of immense archaeological importance. Will you be alright on your own, [Ari]?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/15": "Best of luck! We're all looking forward to your findings!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/2": "Errol, we both know the town's growth will not continue without a reliable source of stone and ore. New artifacts for the museum would be a boon too!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/3": "I can see there is no dissuading you two.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/4": "Alright, alright. We shall proceed with the reopening.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/5": "Be careful [Ari]. The earthquake has revealed cave passages beneath the Mines that are yet unexplored.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/6": "I trust you're ready to handle whatever lies below. Keep your wits about you.",

    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/8": "Good luck. I will do what I can to assist the both of you with your finds at the Museum.",

    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2_follow_up_adeline/init": "The mines are open again? Please be careful down there!",
