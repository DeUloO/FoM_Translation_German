    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/20": "Let's see, we really want to focus on what makes Mistria special, so I think something... simple but elevated...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/20/prompts/0": "Maybe as an amuse bouche?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/20/prompts/1": "How about as a dessert!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/21": "Yeah, to get them excited for the meal to come!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/22": "I bet I could get some pretty good caramelization on this mushroom that would suit a cheese plate...",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/24": "Ahh, what a flavor!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/25": "Thanks for your help [Ari]. It isn't that much food though, is it?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/26": "Tell you what, there's a pot of curry from yesterday downstairs, how about I heat some up for us?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/3": "We've got our pick of the place, [Ari]! Let's make it count!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/3/prompts/0": "Let's go with something local, a real taste of Mistria!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/3/prompts/1": "You got any of those reeeeeal sour gummy candies, Holt?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/4": "I like the way you think!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/5": "Haha, that'll certainly get the judges' attention!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/6": "Now let's see...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/7": "Ooh, these herbs are from Celine's garden. Would you smell that thyme!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/8": "I think we've got our seasoning!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/9": "Thyme will tell, but I think you've made a good choice, Reina.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/init": "[Ari], hey! You ready to do a little shopping?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/1": "I've been giving this a lot of thought and...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/10": "Balor! Back from the Capital?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/11": "I am, and I come bearing some interesting news. The final judge for the Cooking Panel has been selected.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/12": "It's Taliferro...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/13": "There isn't a chef more acclaimed in all of Aldaria, so you can't doubt his abilities, but...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/14": "He's also... prickly.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/15": "Arrogant and overcritical, I'd say.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/15/prompts/0": "No judge is too tough for Reina!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/15/prompts/1": "Someone has to win, so why not Reina?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/16": "I hope you're right!",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/19": "Thanks for the heads up, Balor.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/2": "Will you... be my sous chef? For the contest? I don't think I can do it without you!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/2/prompts/0": "Of course, Reina!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/2/prompts/1": "I'd... I'd love to!",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/21": "I think I may have to redo the menu I planned... Taliferro likes food that has been \"elevated\".",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/22": "This isn't going to be easy...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/22/prompts/0": "Sounds fun! Let's experiment.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/22/prompts/1": "\"Elevated\", huh...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/23": "Yeah... yeah! It will be fun!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/24": "Yeah! We'll just have to think outside the box!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/25": "Let's get cooking, [Ari]! We'll create a menu Taliferro is going to love!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/26": "Alright taste testers! [Ari] and I have made some dishes you've definitely never had before! Help yourselves!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/27": "This curry looks wonderful! Why I-",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/28": "It's so sweet!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/29": "That's right! I've heard extra sweet curry is popular in the Capital. I went with a lot more honey than usual!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/3": "That's a weight off my mind! Thank you!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/30": "I should have started with that, this chocolate cake is... spicy?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/30/prompts/0": "That's the layer of chili-infused ganache!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/30/prompts/1": "It adds a bold kick, right?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/31": "Mom always told us to have dessert last, I've learned my lesson.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/32": "[Ari], I thought we were friends.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/33": "This drink sure is... interesting.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/34": "We mixed in agar to make it richer and thicker. Taliferro's restaurant is well-known for incorporating innovative textures to its menu!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/35": "So what does everyone think?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/36": "Well, it does all taste like something Taliferro might serve...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/37": "I want a =Grilled Cheese=...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/38": "Maple, hush!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/39": "Just make some of the stuff you normally cook, Reina!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/4": "R-really? I'm so glad. Thank you!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/40": "Haha...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/41": "Well thanks for taste testing, everyone. [Ari] and I better get this all cleaned up. Does anyone want leftovers?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/42": "Oh no dear, I'm simply too full!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/43": "Well that could have gone better.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/43/prompts/0": "It was fun though!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/43/prompts/1": "I think the curry has potential.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/44": "It was, but I don't know...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/45": "Yeah, I suppose Eiland might like it.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/46": "Maybe Maple is right. We didn't really showcase Mistrian cooking today, did we?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/47": "I'm not really sure which direction to go in anymore. This is going to be even harder than I thought.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/47/prompts/0": "Whatever you decide to make, I'll be right here to help.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/47/prompts/1": "Win or lose, you're still the best chef I know.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/48": "Thanks, [Ari]. That means a lot.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/49": "Now, I'm going to need you to do me one last favor...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/5": "Would you listen to these two!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/50": "Take some of this $Honey Curry$ home with you. We made WAY too much!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/6": "Let them cook, dear.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/7": "Mom, Dad, we'll be taking over the inn's kitchen to get some practice dishes in.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/8": "As long you're planning to share what you two cook up with the family, feel free!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/9": "Alright, [Ari]. I've got the oven pre-heating, so now it's time to get mixing!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/init": "Hey, [Ari]! You got my letter?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts_follow_up_hemlock/1": "One time I made a sundae with a whole slice of cake on top! And a sparkler! I called it the Hemlock Hooray.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts_follow_up_hemlock/init": "That daughter of mine! She came up with some interesting recipes, huh? Reminds me of my early bartending days.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts_follow_up_josephine/1": "Do your best to support her, [Ari]!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts_follow_up_josephine/init": "Reina's been spending a lot of time lost in thought...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts_follow_up_maple/1": "Maybe I should try and steal a taste off their plates one day, just to be sure it isn't a special noble version.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts_follow_up_maple/init": "Reina told me that nobles eat all sorts of unique food, but I've never seen Adeline or Eiland eat anything I wouldn't!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts_follow_up_reina/1": "I want to share that lifelong love through my food, you know?",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_two_hearts/reina_two_hearts/16": "Yeah, you two are right! Now, how about I cut us all some fresh slices of pie?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_two_hearts/reina_two_hearts/2": "So whatcha think? Didn't that hit the spot?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_two_hearts/reina_two_hearts/2/prompts/0": "T-this is the best slice of pie I've ever had!",
