    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_four_hearts/celine_four_hearts/9": "But I think the seed could use a good wake-up call of nutrients. [Ari], could you add however much plant food you think best?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_four_hearts/celine_four_hearts/init": "Hey, [Ari]! You got my letter?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/1": "I've been trying everything I can think of! Lighting levels, humidity, temperature...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/10": "[Ari] can have some too!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/10/prompts/0": "Let's bring the sprout along, maybe it'd like a change of scenery.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/10/prompts/1": "Fresh out of the oven cobbler? As a treat?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/11": "You might be onto something! It's certainly worth a try.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/12": "Ooh, it does sound good, doesn't it? How about we bring the sprout with us? It might like the change of scenery.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/13": "Yaaaay, it's cobbling time!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/14": "So [Ari], you and Celine are like best friends right? She talks about you all the time.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/15": "Dell!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/16": "Why is your face getting all red like that?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/17": "Why don't you run ahead and let Mom and Dad know we're on our way?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/18": "Okaaaaay!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/19": "Ahaha...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/2": "But it's not growing at all.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/20": "Celine, you brought a friend! Make yourself at home, [Ari].",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/21": "Hope you two are ready for the finest $Cherry Cobbler$ currently in this kitchen!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/22": "We sure are!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/23": "I hope you don't mind, [Ari] and I thought we'd try a little experiment with the sprout.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/24": "A good dessert needs a centerpiece for the table, that's what I always say.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/25": "I don't think I've ever heard you say that, Mom.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/26": "Do you think your plant would like some cobbler? Just so it knows we're all rooting for it.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/27": "Oh Dad...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/27/prompts/0": "It should know we be-leaf in it.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/27/prompts/1": "Yeah! All it needs is some grow-ti-vation!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/28": "[Ari], not you too!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/29": "Hahaha!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/3": "It's one of a kind, so I don't want to try anything too drastic, but at this point I'm running out of ideas.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/3/prompts/0": "What does the Codex say?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/3/prompts/1": "Maybe we could go looking for more seeds?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/30": "Come on, Celine!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/31": "Well, I-",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/32": "I suppose this can be my good seed for the day.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/33": "That's my girl!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/34": "Celine, your plant is growing!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/35": "Oh my gosh!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/36": "A plant that grows on puns, huh? Maybe I missed my calling!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/37": "No no, I don't think it was that... I should get home to write all this down!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/38": "No time for cobbler?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/39": "Ah, r-right. Of course!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/4": "It's not much help, I just haven't translated enough of it...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/5": "We could, but I think we might have gotten really lucky the first time.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/6": "Hey sis! Hey [Ari]!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/7": "Dad baked a $Cherry Cobbler$! Mom says you have to come over cause me and Dad can't eat it all ourselves.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/8": "We totally could though, I don't know what she's talking about.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/9": "Oh, I'd love to! But [Ari] and I are trying to get some important work done.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts/init": "[Ari], you came!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts_follow_up_celine/1": "Isn't this exciting?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts_follow_up_celine/init": "After the sprout's last growth spurt, I think I'm starting to understand the context of some of the words I couldn't translate in the Codex.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts_follow_up_dell/1": "But I'm pretty sure it was magic!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts_follow_up_dell/init": "Celine says there's a perfectly natural explanation for her sprout growing like that...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts_follow_up_holt/1": "Who knows? Could be just the thicket.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts_follow_up_holt/init": "Now I know Celine says that the little sprout doesn't grow off of puns, but whenever I'm over, I make sure to whisper a few to it.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_six_hearts/celine_six_hearts_follow_up_nora/init": "I've never seen a plant grow like that before! My daughter's turned into quite the botanist, hasn't she?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/1": "I'm so glad! Here, look at this...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/10": "Yeah, there's no time like the present! Let's go, [Ari]!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/11": "This is around where I saw it...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/12": "[Ari], could you take my shovel and dig around a little? I'm going to check around the base of the wall.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/13": "What's that you've found, [Ari]?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/14": "I've never seen a seed like this! Could this be the seed of the flower I've been hunting for?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/14/prompts/0": "Only one way to find out!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/14/prompts/1": "I've got a good feeling!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/15": "Oh, this is so exciting!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/16": "You know what, me too!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/17": "Thank you so much for your help, [Ari]! I'll get this seed home and plant it!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/18": "I'll let you know as soon as it sprouts!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/2": "Errol lent this book to me. It's called the Codex Mistria, and it's very old. No one has been able to translate it...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/3": "But it's full of illustrations of Mistria's ancient flora! I'm especially interested in the flowers.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/4": "It's amazing to think that Mistria had such a unique variety of flowers! [Ari], have you ever seen this one?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/4/prompts/0": "No, but it sure is pretty!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/4/prompts/1": "I haven't, but we could try asking Balor.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/5": "Isn't it? I'd love to try growing it myself...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/6": "I've actually asked him, but he hasn't had any luck finding it...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/7": "The odd thing is, I remember seeing this very flower when I was a kid, out near the cottage ruins east of town.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/8": "But I've never seen it since then. Maybe I should try hunting for seeds in the area...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/8/prompts/0": "Good idea, why don't we go now?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/8/prompts/1": "Sounds like an adventure, let's go!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/9": "Ah, r-right now?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts/init": "[Ari], you came! Is this about my letter?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts_follow_up_celine/init": "No luck with the seed yet, [Ari]. Don't worry, I'll let you know if anything changes!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts_follow_up_dell/init": "Did you and Celine really go on an adventure without me? Next time make sure to bring me along, I can be your guard!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Celine/celine_two_hearts/celine_two_hearts_follow_up_nora/init": "Celine told me about your little seed hunting adventure! Thanks for helping her out, she's over the moon about that seed!"
