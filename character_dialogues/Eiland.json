    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/2/prompts/0": "Good thing you've got an assistant now, huh?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/2/prompts/1": "Bet there's a lot of treasure around!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/3": "I'd say you're more of a collaborator! You've got a talent for archaeology, [Ari].",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/4": "Anything we find here could have immense archaeological value! Let's keep our eyes open.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/5": "The writing you uncovered at the stele was illuminating.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/6": "It implies that the people who hid the Dragonsworn armor believed that its ability to defend wasn't just in wearing the armor itself.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/7": "They thought that a single piece of the armor could protect an entire area.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/8": "Which makes me believe that the Western Ruins are a good candidate for uncovering more pieces!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/9": "So are you ready to roll up your sleeves and begin the hunt? It's a big site to cover!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts/init": "[Ari]! Welcome, welcome. Take it all in, isn't it magnificent?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_four_hearts/eiland_four_hearts_follow_up_1/init": "The Dragonsworn's helmet! At our museum! I'm besides myself. Thank you so much, [Ari]!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/1": "Haha... about that...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/10": "It's hardly an adventure, but can I count on you to help me search?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/10/prompts/0": "I'm in! What are friends for?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/10/prompts/1": "Maybe we'll leave today's adventure out of the history books...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/11": "Thank you, [Ari]!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/12": "Haha... I was thinking the same thing.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/13": "Now as you might imagine, I've already done a thorough job of combing through my own rooms. So we'll start with my sister's office.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/14": "Hey, you two!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/15": "Let me guess, you heard I was consolidating old council minutes and want in on the action?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/16": "Don't feel bad saying no. I'm just keeping Adeline company.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/17": "[Ari] and I are on an important mission, hunting for the cloak of the Dragonsworn.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/18": "I believe it may be somewhere in this very building!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/19": "Oh my, how exciting!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/2": "Haha, well... in a sense?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/20": "Well feel free to search my office, but I don't think that I've seen anything like that here.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/21": "I suppose I should conduct a search of my own room then.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/22": "Oh, I'd be happy to help-",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/23": "Let's leave your auntie some privacy, eh?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/24": "This takes me back. It's a bit like the signet ring all over again, isn't it?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/25": "When we were kids, Eiland found an old ring down in the basement.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/26": "He liked it so much he and Mother did a bunch of research to find out whose crest was on it.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/27": "It turned out to be the signet ring of a very, very old Caldosian dynasty, long thought lost.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/28": "Well Mother was so proud, she had it sent off to the Capital to be verified, and then the Caldosians got word of it...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/28/prompts/0": "The Caldosians must have been thrilled!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/28/prompts/1": "Let me guess, you didn't get your ring back?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/29": "It ended up being a bit of an international incident, actually.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/3": "After translating the text and putting the clues together, I have become convinced that the next piece of the armor is...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/30": "It would have ended up in a museum regardless, but no.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/31": "Well, it certainly gave you your taste for archaeology at any rate.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/32": "And the Caldosians got their ring back eventually. I even got an official thank you letter from their Emperor.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/33": "Fooooound it!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/34": "Aunt Elsie, perhaps you should let a certified archaeologist check first-",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/35": "It really IS the Dragonsworn Cloak! It certainly doesn't look that ancient, does it?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/36": "Wherever did you find it?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/37": "In my wardrobe. When I moved in I just shoved everything still in there as far back as it would go.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/38": "Can you believe it, [Ari]? The third piece of the Dragonsworn Armor! Were there any notes with it? A storage box?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/39": "Oh no, it was folded up among a pile of old blankets.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/4": "In this very house.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/40": "I was afraid of this.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/41": "With no clues, it will make the next piece that much harder to find.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/42": "Maybe it's recorded somewhere in the annals of the house? Those go back hundreds of years.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/43": "I think that might be our best bet.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/44": "Let's hope our quest doesn't end here, [Ari].",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/44/prompts/0": "We won't stop till we complete the armor!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/44/prompts/1": "Three out of however many ain't bad!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/45": "You're right! This is just another challenge to overcome.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/46": "It's true, what we've recovered so far is amazing.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/47": "Whatever comes next, I say it's high time to celebrate what you two have achieved.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/48": "And you!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/49": "Just so! I'm going to get a bottle of that very old wine from down cellar.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/5": "I believe we are looking for the Dragonsworn Cloak, a truly excellent example of \"Dynweaving\" that imparted the cloth with incredible durability.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/50": "Cheers everyone!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/6": "Legends say it could turn aside swords, and even arrows couldn't pierce it.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/7": "However, at some point the cloak became a symbol of the leader of Mistria. As fashion sensibilities changed, well...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/8": "Frankly, I think it ended up tucked away in some odd corner of the house.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/9": "Luckily for us, nothing ever gets thrown away around here.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/init": "Thank you for coming, [Ari].",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/init/prompts/0": "Where are we off to? Ancient ruins? A forgotten temple?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/init/prompts/1": "Let me guess, you found a secret labyrinth in the Manor!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/1": "Magnificent, isn't it? It's very old, certainly older than the town around it. You can find steles like this all over the country, although ours is in particularly good shape.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/1/prompts/0": "Stele?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/1/prompts/1": "Do you think it marks where treasure is buried?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/10": "A hidden compartment?! Don't tell me-",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/11": "Incredible, they're a perfect match for the ones on the stele! The Dragonsworn's Greaves! Here this whole time!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/12": "And look inside the hidden compartment, there's more writing!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/13": "This will take time to translate... Can you hand me the greaves, [Ari]?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/14": "Thank you. Now to get these to the museum!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/2": "An ancient monument. They were put up for all sorts of reasons. Memorials, to mark boundaries, or to commemorate great events.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/3": "Wouldn't that be nice! However, people who hide treasure usually don't mark it so obviously.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/4": "Our stele depicts a legendary set of armor, worn by someone called the Dragonsworn. It's quite unique!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/5": "Supposedly the Dragonsworn was a nearly mythical being who aided the dragons in the ancient days of the world. Could you imagine!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/5/prompts/0": "Y-you don't say!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/5/prompts/1": "Haha, d-do you think they're still around?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/6": "Of course, legends do tend to be full of, well, legendary figures. The truth of the matter has been lost.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/7": "Very funny! I'd settle just for finding their armor!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/8": "Although the armor and the details around the Dragonsworn have been lost to us, thanks to this stele, we do have some clues. Come here!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/9": "If you place your hands along the surface of the stele, you should still be able to feel raised lettering that's undetectable at first glance.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/init": "[Ari], welcome! Come on, it's this way.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_1/1": "I'll let you know as soon as I'm done translating the new text. Could you imagine if it led us to another piece of the armor?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_1/init": "I don't know if the earthquake dislodged something from the mechanism in the stele, or if it was just luck, but I can't thank you enough.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_2/init": "[Ari]! Would you look at you! A find like a piece of the Dragonsworn's Armor set is every archaeologist's dream!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/translating_the_earth_tablet/translating_the_earth_tablet_follow_up_eiland/1": "To think she was stumped and had to ask for help!",

    "Cutscenes/Story Events/Mines/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2/unlocking_the_mines_pt_2_follow_up_eiland/1": "And let me know if there's anything worth surveying down there!",
