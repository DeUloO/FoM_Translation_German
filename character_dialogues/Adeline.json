    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/6": "Really Adeline, things have been going swimmingly in Mistria with you at the helm. Although...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/7": "Try not to push yourself so hard, you hear? You must be exhausted with all that running around.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/8": "Don't forget that taking care of Mistria includes taking care of yourself. Right [Ari]?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/9": "Ah... but there's still a lot of ground to cover.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/extra_0": "It's sweet of Landen to look out for me, but really... I'm okay!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/extra_1": "I just need to make sure I'm keeping on top of everything.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/extra_1/prompts/0": "Maybe we should take a break?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/extra_1/prompts/1": "Really, the town is doing great!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/init": "There you are, [Ari]. I'm so glad you could make it!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/1": "Welcome to the party, dear!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/10": "And I'm handling our tax documents for the season! Sorry to hog the really fun work, everyone!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/11": "[Ari], I'd like you to come over here and review the work we've already done. It'll give you a good overview and make sure we haven't made any mistakes!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/12": "But you've already double checked everything, Adeline.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/13": "Nothing better than a triple check, it's so satisfying!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/13/prompts/0": "Wow, thanks Adeline!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/13/prompts/1": "Wow, uh, thanks Adeline...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/14": "Oh, [Ari]! You're very welcome!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/15": "Haha, well, I appreciate that you're willing to give it a try.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/16": "And when we're done, I've ordered up a special tray of treats from the Inn to celebrate! Whoever finishes first gets first pick!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/17": "Well, why didn't you say so earlier!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/2": "Oh no, I hope Adeline didn't bully you into this, [Ari].",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/3": "Nonsense! Not all of us are as averse to paperwork as you, Eiland. Right, [Ari]?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/3/prompts/0": "I love the smell of drying ink!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/3/prompts/1": "Well, I guess I'm about to find out!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/4": "Oh! Me too!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/5": "I'm sure you'll have a great time!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/6": "Let me take you around the room. Great Aunt Elsie is working on applying for grants from the Capital...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/7": "There's certainly a trick to getting what you want out of those nobles. Unfortunately for them, I've had plenty of practice!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/8": "My dear brother is taking care of large excavation site procedural paperwork...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/9": "Honestly, with the archaic way these forms have been written, you'd think they were historical artifacts themselves!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/init": "[Ari], you came!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/1": "Your timing is perfect! I'm sure you're eager to start helping Mistria and its citizens, so I'm here to tell you all about our town's $Request Board$. Come with me!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/10": "With your help we'll repair the earthquake's damage, raise Mistria's $Town Rank$, and put this village back on the map!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/11": "Why don't you go ahead now and accept your first $Request$? It's one I just put up for you!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/12": "Perfect! That was easy, right?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/13": "I'm sure you want to meet your new neighbors as much as they want to meet you!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/14": "And as you get to know them better, your $Journal$ can keep track of your relationships with them and even document their favorite gifts.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/14/prompts/0": "And what do you like, Adeline?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/14/prompts/1": "And what can I do to make you like me, Adeline?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/15": "Well, =Tulips= are nice, and they are in season right now! I hope you'll be growing some on your farm!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/16": "Ah-",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/17": "Well, I wouldn't say no to a =Tulip=, [Ari].",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/18": "A-Anyway we've still got a lot of things to talk about!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/19": "You can view the $Map$ in your $Journal$. It should give you a good idea where people are, isn't that helpful? And each time you meet someone, it will update!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/2": "As the name implies, villagers post their $Requests$ here every day. You'll receive rewards whenever you complete them!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/20": "You can think of this as the first step on our path to restoring the town.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/21": "Isn't this exciting? Come talk to me once you're done meeting everyone!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/3": "It's a great way to earn $Money$, $Equipment$, and most importantly, $Renown$!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/3/prompts/0": "Renown?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/3/prompts/1": "Can't wait to get started!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/4": "Ah yes, let me explain the basics...",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/5": "I'm so glad! Allow me to explain the basics of $Renown$...",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/6": "As you know, Mistria is just one of the many towns that make up the Kingdom of Aldaria. All of them receive a $Town Rank$ according to their $Renown Level$.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/7": "Towns with a higher $Town Rank$ enjoy more popularity and more support from the Capital.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/8": "Mistria's $Renown Level$ was improving prior to the earthquake... Since then, though, we're down two entire $Town Ranks$.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/9": "As daughter and heiress of Mistria's Baron, improving this situation is my highest priority.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board/init": "Hi there, [Ari]! I was hoping I'd run into you!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/adeline_quest_board/adeline_quest_board_follow_up/init": "Don't forget to check your Journal's $Map$, it's a great way to help you find your way around!",
    "letters/adeline_4h_reward_1/local": "[Ari],\n\nThank you so much for your help yesterday! I know everyone in town will really appreciate these extra materials, and I'm sure you'll put yours to good use.\n\nThis was a great choice!",
    "letters/adeline_4h_reward_1/subject_line": "Thanks Again!",
    "letters/adeline_4h_reward_2/local": "[Ari],\n\nThank you so much for your help yesterday! We got the shipment of cookies in this morning, and it made the whole Manor House smell like a bakery! \n\nI hope you enjoy your cookie (Eiland already ate his...).\n\nThis was a great choice!",
    "letters/adeline_4h_reward_2/subject_line": "Thank You!"
